                Let’s skip the niceties. I’m motivated. We’re all motivated. You’re looking for someone that can do everything you need, that works well with others, and that has an impeccable work ethic. I’d like this page to stand as a testament to those skills. These projects were completed within deadlines as part of a group effort, and all of us pulled our weight. But you don’t want just anyone who works well in a group. What sets me apart? Two things: Determination and creativity.<br><br>
            I’m determined to learn, and to never stop learning. It’s why I’m where I am today. I graduated from UNC-Chapel hill with a double major in anthropology and biology and picked up a minor in environmental science as well. While my full-time job since graduation has focused on chemical analysis, I’ve continued to educate myself in various fields. Eventually, this led to my curiosity in programming, and from there it was a short jump to the coding bootcamp at UNC. By its very nature web development requires a love, not just of coding, but of learning. I have, and I will continue, to run into problems that I’ve never come across before. Each one is a learning opportunity worth exploring.<br><br>
            Secondly, I’ve always been a creative person. I recently submitted a science-fiction manuscript for (hopefully) publishing. I find that being able to look at problems from different angles has allowed me to solve them in ways that others have not thought of. The more tools I am given, the more different solutions I can find, and it is this creativity that has allowed me to complete the projects showcased in this portfolio to the degree that I have.<br><br>
            Between my determination and my creativity I am not just your run-of-the-mill aspiring web developer. Whatever project is put in front of me, I will complete it. And I will learn from it.
